**TODO**
[x] Mouse circle buggy when tracking movement on MacOS (Safari)
--- Currently disabled for MacOS by targeted MacOS CSS
[] Make demo link more noticeable (?)
[] Make and add new project images for:
--- SkateSpot
[] Change px to em/rem/ch
[] Custom error pages (offline, 404, etc)
[] Support for QHD / 4K browsers
[] Optimize files (use as many SVG as possible)
[] Optimize file structure (avoid having to load duplicate content)
