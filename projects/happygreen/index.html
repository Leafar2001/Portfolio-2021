          From February 2022 to June 2022, I worked as an intern at HappyGreen
          in Eindhoven as a part of my IT & Media Design bachelor's degree at
          the Fontys University of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven.

        <p data-aos="fade-up">
          As previously stated, I worked as an intern at HappyGreen for 5
          months. I found HappyGreen with the Fontys internship tool and they
          immediately sparked my interest. After a brief e-mail exchange I
          went to their office for a quick meet & greet and to assess if I was
          the right fit for them.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">
          I quickly noticed HappyGreen was a small team consisting of young,
          tech-savvy people that wanted to use modern technologies to improve
          the world, which really interested me.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">
          During my internship I adopted the already existing Agile methods
          used like Scrum. Working in 2-week sprints and a couple of
          daily/weekly stand-ups, I used Jira, as it had a good integration
          with Git and the existing codebase.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">
          As for Git, this is also what was used throughout this internship
          for code version control. I achieved this by cloning the existing
          repository and then using pull requests and reviews from colleagues
          and superiors to merge my code with the existing code.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">
          The team I worked with consisted of a couple of people.
          <a href="https://github.com/Frankisgek">Frank Keulen</a> (owner,
          supervisor, back-end developer, API manager, resident
          jack-of-all-trades) was my go-to problem solver for all kinds of
          questions during my internship. Besides Frank I also had a lot of
          contact with
          <a href="https://github.com/DaveyvdBogaard">Davey van den Bogaard</a>
          (lead developer working on WEAR) when it came to developing the WEAR
          app. Ofcourse I also talked with others at HappyGreen, however most
          of those talks weren't directly impacting my internship or project.

        <p data-aos="fade-up">
          <a href="https://happy.green/">HappyGreen</a> is a fast-growing
          start-up that designs and creates innovative and eco-friendly
          products & services from the ground up. HappyGreen is currently

          that can be controlled with a mobile app, innovative electric
          transport, new ways to recycle, forestation and educational

        <p data-aos="fade-up">
          As the intern, HappyGreen will provide me with capable mentors and
          colleagues that can guide me during this process. There are many
          areas of expertise covered by HappyGreen employees that i can
          receive guidance in, such as UX/UI design, front- & back-end
          development, Marketing, Concepting, and research.

          The main internship assignment will be based around HappyGreen's
          WEAR app. This is a mobile app thats connected to HappyGreen's NFC
          wearables (wooden accessories like bracelets, sunglasses, watches)
          to control their NFC chip, such as opening Instagram and Spotify or
          unlocking / controlling your Tesla through the app. These actions
          can then be automatically ran by scanning your wearable with your
          phone. The current prototypes for these wearables are mainly focused
          on the consumer side of things. HappyGreen's goal in this is to also
          make WEAR available and attractive from a business perspective.

          The current WEAR app includes a bunch of functionality for the
          wearables. My goal is to find the best ways to integrate
          functionality that can be used by businesses or people in a working
          environment. Some of the current WEAR features include:
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">
          - Opening apps like Spotify, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp. <br />-

            Starting off my project was research. The goal for this phase was
            to get a better understanding of sustainability and how it could
            be used to improve businesses in any way. It was also the phase
            where I tried to think out of the box to find innovative ideas by
            doing lots of library research and organizing brainstorms.

            To see which ideas my colleagues associate with certain topics, I
            organized a brainstorm in <a href="https://miro.com">Miro</a>.
            This brainstorm consisted of 3 sessions. These were all timed
            sessions, being timed at 1, 3 and 5 minutes respectively. The idea
            of timed sessions created a sense of urgency, which would
            sometimes help creativity. Because we weren't sure about which
            direction we wanted the business WEAR concept to go, I split the
            ideas into 3 categories: ideas for sustainability & CO2 footprint,
            ideas with NFC, and user incentives.

            For the entire design process, I used the popular UX / UI design
            tool <a href="https://figma.com">Figma</a>. I did not have any
            previous experience with Figma as my UI design tool of choice used
            to be Adobe XD. However, since some of the existing designs were
            already implemented into Figma, me and the company both felt it
            was a good idea to use Figma throughout this process.

            There were multiple things I designed while i was at HappyGreen.
            The main project was to design the UI and user flow for the new
            business implementation in the WEAR app, however I also
            experimented with designing other things such as a new login
            screen, a design for the new multi-action (run multiple actions at
            once) for the WEAR app, and other small stuff.

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Since the design was made in Figma, the obvious choice was to use
            Figma for the prototyping aswell. Because my supervisor wasn't
            sure about which navigation type (tab-based, stack-based,
            conditional rendering) to use yet, I made 3 different navigation
            flows that led to the same user flow afterwards. We ended up
            choosing tab-based as it had the best user experience according to
            me and my supervisor.

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The prototyping phase mainly consisted of connecting the screens
            to eachother and making sure all screens were linked to the
            corresponding action. After getting feedback from my supervisor on
            usability and UX of the prototype, I moved on to the next phase
            where I started performing user tests on the prototype.

            Prototype testing started with myself and my supervisor. To
            further test the UX of my design / prototype I used a prototyping
            tool called
            <a href="https://maze.co/">Maze</a>. This app has seamless
            integration with a bunch of design tools including Figma, and I
            used this to give users a series of questions and steps to walk
            through in the app. The users I performed this test on were my
            colleagues.

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Maze allows the creator of the "maze" (in this case, me) to have
            insights such as how long it took a user to complete a task, and
            helps better understand UX problems within the prototype.

            To hone my skills and get more familiar with technologies used to

            I developed this to get a better understanding of React Native
            (the framework used to develop the WEAR app) and the WEAR API
            (where all data regarding products and the WEAR app is stored).
            This took me a couple of days and I was able to build a pretty

            Besides working on the business designs of WEAR, I was also able

            redesign was to approach a more modern UI style and inspire the
            user to login using a service such as Apple, Google or Facebook.
            Ofcourse keeping in mind the cleanliness and style of the existing
            WEAR app, I went for a clean and modern login screen focusing on
            the social login buttons.

            of this login screen was positive, as it was mostly revamping old
            code. There were a couple bugs my colleagues pointed out, such as
            the keyboard not moving with the input fields when focused,
            however I was able to fix all of these small bugs quite fast.
