            From February 2022 to June 2022, I worked as an intern at HappyGreen
            in Eindhoven as a part of my IT & Media Design bachelor's degree at
            the Fontys University of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven.

          <h1>Internship info</h1>
          <p>
            As previously stated, I worked as an intern at HappyGreen for 5
            months. I found HappyGreen with the Fontys internship tool and they
            immediately sparked my interest. After a brief e-mail exchange I
            went to their office for a quick meet & greet and to assess if I was
            the right fit for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I quickly noticed HappyGreen was a small team consisting of young,
            tech-savvy people that wanted to use modern technologies to improve
            the world, which really interested me.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my internship I adopted the already existing Agile methods
            used like Scrum. Working in 2-week sprints and a couple of
            daily/weekly stand-ups, I used Jira, as it had a good integration
            with Git and the existing codebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for Git, this is also what was used throughout this internship
            for code version control. I achieved this by cloning the existing
            repository and then using pull requests and reviews from colleagues
            and superiors to merge my code with the existing code.
          </p>
          <p>
            The team I worked with consisted of a couple of people.
            <a href="https://github.com/Frankisgek">Frank Keulen</a> (owner,
            supervisor, back-end developer, API manager, resident
            jack-of-all-trades) was my go-to problem solver for all kinds of
            questions during my internship. Besides Frank I also had a lot of
            contact with
            <a href="https://github.com/DaveyvdBogaard"
              >Davey van den Bogaard</a
            >
            (lead developer working on WEAR) when it came to developing the WEAR
            app. Ofcourse I also talked with others at HappyGreen, however most
            of those talks weren't directly impacting my internship or project.

            local companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the intern, HappyGreen will provide me with capable mentors and
            colleagues that can guide me during this process. There are many
            areas of expertise covered by HappyGreen employees that i can
            receive guidance in, such as UX/UI design, front- & back-end
            development, Marketing, Concepting, and research.

          <h1>The project</h1>
          <p>
            The main internship assignment will be based around HappyGreen's
            WEAR app. This is a mobile app thats connected to HappyGreen's NFC
            wearables (wooden accessories like bracelets, sunglasses, watches)
            to control their NFC chip, such as opening Instagram and Spotify or
            unlocking / controlling your Tesla through the app. These actions
            can then be automatically ran by scanning your wearable with your
            phone. The current prototypes for these wearables are mainly focused
            on the consumer side of things. HappyGreen's goal in this is to also
            make WEAR available and attractive from a business perspective.
          </p>
          <p>Attached below is the official project plan.</p>

          <p>
            The current WEAR app includes a bunch of functionality for the
            wearables. My goal is to find the best ways to integrate
            functionality that can be used by businesses or people in a working
            environment. Some of the current WEAR features include:
          </p>
          <p>
            - Opening apps like Spotify, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp. <br />-
            Shuffling or opening Spotify / Sonos playlists<br />- Controlling
            smarthome accessories like Phillips Hue lights and Nuki smartlocks.
            <br />- Unlocking and controlling a Tesla car.

            Ofcourse these aren't all the features of the WEAR app and as the
            WEAR app is still in development more features will be added in due
            time, but they should give you a general idea of what's possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            To start off the project and give myself and HappyGreen a rough idea
            of how I would spend my time during this internship, I made a
            planning for each sprint (2 weeks). Attached below is the sprint
            planning.

            The project is split up into 5 stages: research, design,
            prototyping, testing and development. For each of these stages i
            will go more in-depth on what I wanted to achieve during that stage,
            and how I achieved it.
          </p>
          <div class="mt-md sidenav--item" id="project--research">
            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>
              Starting off my project was research. The goal for this phase was
              to get a better understanding of sustainability and how it could
              be used to improve businesses in any way. It was also the phase
              where I tried to think out of the box to find innovative ideas by
              doing lots of library research and organizing brainstorms.
            </p>
            <p>
              To have a good baseline, me and my supervisor were able to ask
              ourselves the following research questions to base all research
              on:
            </p>
            <p>
              - How can the WEAR app and its functionality be used from a
              business perspective?
              <br />
              --- Which markets are interesting for HappyGreen?<br />
              --- What type of functionality is interesting for each market?
              (WEAR)<br />
              --- What kind of adjustments are needed within the existing WEAR
              app?
            </p>
            <p>
              To find out more about the NFC technology used for WEAR and
              existing concepts using this technology, I made a small library
              research document:
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="button-container">
              <a
                href="../../src/files/happygreen/research/General NFC research.pdf"
                class="btn"
                target="_blank"
              >
                <span>General NFC research</span>
              </a>
            </div>
            <br />
            <p>
              This document gave me a couple of ideas and topics that could
              possible be used for the WEAR business app.
            </p>
            <p>
              To see which ideas my colleagues associate with certain topics, I
              organized a brainstorm in <a href="https://miro.com">Miro</a>.
              This brainstorm consisted of 3 sessions. These were all timed
              sessions, being timed at 1, 3 and 5 minutes respectively. The idea
              of timed sessions created a sense of urgency, which would
              sometimes help creativity. Because we weren't sure about which
              direction we wanted the business WEAR concept to go, I split the
              ideas into 3 categories: ideas for sustainability & CO2 footprint,
              ideas with NFC, and user incentives.

              Once all sessions were done, I filtered & categorised every idea

              understanding of which markets have alot of attractive ideas. It
              also served as a building block for the rest of the ideas.

              With a bunch of ideas and categories, I started applying these to
              think of a couple concepts for WEAR, accompanied by some design
              inspiration and a list of possible functionalities. They can be
              found in the WEAR concept document linked below.

              Because HappyGreen stands for a greener & better world, we wanted
              to see how we could implement sustainability into the WEAR
              business app. To find out which kind of data was available to us,
              I made a list of modern carbon footprint API's that could aid us
              in the future to process and show different types of
              sustainability data.

              While most of this research was simple library research, I was
              able to bounce off my colleagues about ideas and concepts to see
              which inspired them the most. Ofcourse my supervisor also had a
              lot of say in this as it is a feature that HappyGreen has been
              thinking about for a while.

              The goal for the design phase was to create a new subset of user
              interfaces for the WEAR business app that adhere to the current
              WEAR designs.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the entire design process, I used the popular UX / UI design
              tool <a href="https://figma.com">Figma</a>. I did not have any
              previous experience with Figma as my UI design tool of choice used
              to be Adobe XD. However, since some of the existing designs were
              already implemented into Figma, me and the company both felt it
              was a good idea to use Figma throughout this process.
            </p>
            <p>
              There were multiple things I designed while i was at HappyGreen.
              The main project was to design the UI and user flow for the new
              business implementation in the WEAR app, however I also
              experimented with designing other things such as a new login
              screen, a design for the new multi-action (run multiple actions at
              once) for the WEAR app, and other small stuff.

              Above you can see part of the Figma file with my designs from this
              internship. Feel free to look around. The file contains elements I
              worked on such as WEAR business manager flows, business actions, a
              new login screen, multi-actions, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the design process I received a bunch of feedback from my
              supervisor Frank. He left comments on specific elements that could
              use an improvement or weren't intuitive. Based on this feedback I
              created different versions and iterations to end up with a
              functional and well-designed end product.

              After multiple iterations based on feedback and user testing I

            <h4>Prototyping</h4>
            <p>
              With the design done it was time to move onto prototyping. Here I
              wanted to visualize the flows and create a clickable version of
              the design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the design was made in Figma, the obvious choice was to use
              Figma for the prototyping aswell. Because my supervisor wasn't
              sure about which navigation type (tab-based, stack-based,
              conditional rendering) to use yet, I made 3 different navigation
              flows that led to the same user flow afterwards. We ended up
              choosing tab-based as it had the best user experience according to
              me and my supervisor, aswell as being used for a large amount of
              similar mobile apps.
            </p>
            <p>
              The prototyping phase mainly consisted of connecting the screens
              to eachother and making sure all screens were linked to the
              corresponding action. After getting feedback from my supervisor on
              usability and UX of the prototype, I moved on to the next phase
              where I started performing user tests on the prototype.

              Just like in the design phase, my supervisor Frank left me with a
              bunch of comments to improve the prototype. This time the comments
              were less design-focused, but moreso showing me ways to improve
              the user flow or fixing bugs / bad UX in the prototype.

              Once the prototype was complete and all flows were connected to
              the right UI elements, I wanted to perform user tests on it to
              improve the UX.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prototype testing started with myself and my supervisor. To
              further test the UX of my design / prototype I used a prototyping
              tool called
              <a href="https://maze.co/">Maze</a>. This app has seamless
              integration with a bunch of design tools including Figma, and I
              used this to give users a series of questions and steps to walk
              through in the app. The users I performed this test on were my
              colleagues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maze allows the creator of the "maze" (in this case, me) to have
              insights such as how long it took a user to complete a task, and
              helps better understand UX problems within the prototype.
            </p>
            <p>
              For more info on this testing phase, I documented this into a
              file:
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="button-container">

            <br />
            <p>
              I'm glad I used Maze as it was a very useful tool that gave me a
              bunch of insight on how users behaved throughout the prototype. It
              allowed me to answer questions like "which flows need to be
              improved?" and "do people need to be tech-savvy to understand the
              UI?" which ultimately lead to a succesful testing phase.

              In between the design & prototyping phases I've also already done
              some developing. The goal for this phase was to get familiar with
              all the technologies used within the WEAR app, then start by
              developing smaller components and receiving feedback. Once I was a
              little more familiar with the technology and architecture used to
              build the WEAR app, I was able to start working on the business
              implementation I designed.

            <p>
              To have a good list of priorities while developing this MVP, I
              made a MoSCoW overview of all functionalities.

              The first thing I worked on was the navigation. As there was
              already an existing app that had to coexist with the new business
              app, I had to rearrange the way navigation worked. This was tough
              but with some tips from my colleagues I was able to render
              different screens and ways of navigation based on a users role
              (for example, non-managers dont need to see the business
              management side of things).
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the navigation worked, I started creating the core components
              and UI of the main screens. In the beginning I used dummy data,
              but after the new back-end was sorted and the database was
              configured for the business WEAR app, I started making calls to
              the WEAR API that were then stored in the state through Redux.
              This helped alot to make the app feel like a real thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once I had a presentable MVP I started working on UI and
              functionality throughout the app, adding one small feature at a
              time, such as connecting a product to a user.

              I learned alot from the design & prototyping phase such as working
              with new UI design tools such as Figma, and testing the prototypes
              with Maze. Other than these tools, I also learned alot from my
              supervisor Frank in terms of design thinking and how to really put
              myself in the user's shoes.

            <h4>App</h4>
            <p>
              I'm happy with the MVP I was able to develop. It involves key
              features such as tab-based navigation, user and product overviews,
              organization info, adding new users, connecting & disconnecting
              products from users, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of these functions are connected to a newly generated back-end
              for this WEAR organization app. I was responsible for all the
              front-end interfaces and connectivity, as well as connecting
              everything to the back-end by calling the API and extracting the
              neccessary data from the response, which was then stored in the
              state with Redux. Based on this data I was then able to create
              dynamic UI components that translated this data to the front-end.
            </p>
            <p>
              While I did have a lot of input in how the back-end should be
              organized and features it should contain, my colleagues were
              responsible for "creating" the back-end endpoints for me to
              connect to.

              brushing up on my JavaScript knowledge, I also learned what it was
              like to work alongside a team of developers and using proper
              version control systems such as combining Jira issues with GitHub
              pull requests, and automation with GitHub actions / workflows (I
              even added some Git workflows to this portfolio website during my
              internship by having automatic deployment based on Git pushes).

            Below are the official FHICT internship learning outcomes and what I
            did to achieve them.
          </p>
          <h4 class="mt-md">Learning outcome 1:</h4>
          <p class="text-bold text-italic">
            "Autonomously find and acquire an internship assignment which builds
            upon previously acquired knowledge and skills."
          </p>
          <p>
            By using the FHICT internship tool and looking for interesting
            companies that operate in the media or software market, I was able
            to inquire for an internship at HappyGreen which included tasks that
            build upon my previously acquired knowledge.
          </p>
          <h4 class="mt-md">Learning outcome 2:</h4>
          <p class="text-bold text-italic">
            "Perform a problem analysis resulting in a clearly defined
            assignment covering the core aspects and intended results."
          </p>
          <p>
            By analyzing the wants and needs of the company I was able to come
            up with a project plan that defined a problem and came with a
            fitting solution.
          </p>
          <h4 class="mt-md">Learning outcome 3:</h4>
          <p class="text-bold text-italic">
            "Work independently, according to plan, and methodically correct in
            a realistic practice situation, and work with a research attitude to
            collect, organise and select the appropriate information, resulting
            in professional products."
          </p>
          <p>
            By being involved in the entire process, going from research ->
            design -> prototyping -> testing -> developing, I showed that I was
            able to create professional products based on information gathered.

            functioning in the working environment now and in the future."
          </p>
          <p>
            By regularly conversing with my colleagues and supervisor about how
            the internship felt to me and define which tasks went well and felt
            more fun than others, and then writing this down in a reflection, I
            was able to reflect upon my own qualities and preferences that I
            realized during this internship.

          <h4 class="mt-md">Learning outcome 5:</h4>
          <p class="text-bold text-italic">

            practical situation."

          <p>
            By being a part of weekly stand-ups and using version control &
            scrum tools such as Jira and Git, I was able to work in a team and
            collaborate with colleagues. I also kept my supervisor and
            colleagues informed on the status of Jira issues and requested code
            reviews when needed.

            During my internship I didn't only work on the main assignment, but
            also some things that can be placed into the "other" category. Think
            of these as side-projects I worked on that weren't directly
            affecting my main assignment, but helped in other ways such as
            gaining experience with a certain technology used within HappyGreen.

            <h4>WEAR app clone</h4>
            <p>
              To hone my skills and get more familiar with technologies used to
              develop the WEAR app, I made a "fake" WEAR app made from scratch.
              I developed this to get a better understanding of React Native
              (the framework used to develop the WEAR app) and the WEAR API
              (where all data regarding products and the WEAR app is stored).
              This took me a couple of days and I was able to build a pretty
              good prototype version of the WEAR app from scratch.

              It has functionality to showcase products, filter products, add a
              product to a user, login as a user (using an API token), add an
              action to a product, change a product's name, and more.

              by forking the repository and adding a feature to it. The feature
              I worked on was displaying certain Pokemon (with data gathered
              through the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a>) and
              managing their state with Redux, like changing the name
              (client-side) of a Pokemon and storing it in the Redux state,
              aswell as adding a loading indicator when the Pokemon is in a
              "loading" state.

              Besides working on the business designs of WEAR, I was also able
              to redesign some very old login screens. The goal for this
              redesign was to approach a more modern UI style and inspire the
              user to login using a service such as Apple, Google or Facebook.
              Ofcourse keeping in mind the cleanliness and style of the existing
              WEAR app, I went for a clean and modern login screen focusing on
              the social login buttons.

            <p>
              After designing the new login screen, I also implemented it by
              rewriting the old React Native code to apply the new styles and
              have cleaner code. The feedback I received on the implementation
              of this login screen was positive, as it was mostly revamping old
              code. There were a couple bugs my colleagues pointed out, such as
              the keyboard not moving with the input fields when focused,
              however I was able to fix all of these small bugs quite fast.

          <p>
            This internship has been a great learning experience for me. I
            really got to feel what it was like working in a team of developers
            and contributing to a real product.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall I think the internship period went well and I learned what I
            wanted to learn. I'm satisfied with the end products and the steps
            it took me to get there. Being able to be involved every step of the
            way isn't always how it goes for interns, so I'm glad HappyGreen
            gave me the opportunity to learn in alot of areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            This internship also showed me how the worlds of design &
            development combine into a whole in the real world. It's been great
            to see how I can be involved in a project from start to finish, and
            this process has also helped me realize what I want to keep on doing
            once I have my degree, which is continuing on to be a front-end
            developer that dabbles in design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm thankful for all the feedback my colleagues and supervisors gave
            me throughout this internship. Luckily it was all positive and I
            believe HappyGreen was happy to have me as an intern.
