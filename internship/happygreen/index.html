          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            From February 2022 to June 2022, I worked as an intern at HappyGreen
            in Eindhoven as a part of my IT & Media Design bachelor's degree at
            the Fontys University of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven.
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            As previously stated, I worked as an intern at HappyGreen for 5
            months. I found HappyGreen with the Fontys internship tool and they
            immediately sparked my interest. After a brief e-mail exchange I
            went to their office for a quick meet & greet and to assess if I was
            the right fit for them.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            I quickly noticed HappyGreen was a small team consisting of young,
            tech-savvy people that wanted to use modern technologies to improve
            the world, which really interested me.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            During my internship I adopted the already existing Agile methods
            used like Scrum. Working in 2-week sprints and a couple of
            daily/weekly stand-ups, I used Jira, as it had a good integration
            with Git and the existing codebase.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            As for Git, this is also what was used throughout this internship
            for code version control. I achieved this by cloning the existing
            repository and then using pull requests and reviews from colleagues
            and superiors to merge my code with the existing code.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The team I worked with consisted of a couple of people.
            <a href="https://github.com/Frankisgek">Frank Keulen</a> (owner,
            supervisor, back-end developer, API manager, resident
            jack-of-all-trades) was my go-to problem solver for all kinds of
            questions during my internship. Besides Frank I also had a lot of
            contact with
            <a href="https://github.com/DaveyvdBogaard"
              >Davey van den Bogaard</a
            >
            (lead developer working on WEAR) when it came to developing the WEAR
            app. Ofcourse I also talked with others at HappyGreen, however most
            of those talks weren't directly impacting my internship or project.

            <a href="https://happy.green/">HappyGreen</a> is a fast-growing
            start-up that designs and creates innovative and eco-friendly
            products & services from the ground up. HappyGreen is currently
            expanding into the latin-american market. A couple of HappyGreen's
            products are: a high-tech mobile hotel room, a personal eco retreat
            that can be controlled with a mobile app, innovative electric
            transport, new ways to recycle, forestation and educational
            projects.

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            HappyGreen is based in The Netherlands and Panama. There are roughly
            ~20 people working for HappyGreen fulltime and these people collab
            with over 180 others through collaborations and partnerships with
            local companies.

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            As the intern, HappyGreen will provide me with capable mentors and
            colleagues that can guide me during this process. There are many
            areas of expertise covered by HappyGreen employees that i can
            receive guidance in, such as UX/UI design, front- & back-end
            development, Marketing, Concepting, and research.

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The main internship assignment will be based around HappyGreen's
            WEAR app. This is a mobile app thats connected to HappyGreen's NFC
            wearables (wooden accessories like bracelets, sunglasses, watches)
            to control their NFC chip, such as opening Instagram and Spotify or
            unlocking / controlling your Tesla through the app. These actions
            can then be automatically ran by scanning your wearable with your
            phone. The current prototypes for these wearables are mainly focused
            on the consumer side of things. HappyGreen's goal in this is to also
            make WEAR available and attractive from a business perspective.

            The current WEAR app includes a bunch of functionality for the
            wearables. My goal is to find the best ways to integrate
            functionality that can be used by businesses or people in a working
            environment. Some of the current WEAR features include:
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            - Opening apps like Spotify, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp. <br />-

            To start off the project and give myself and HappyGreen a rough idea
            of how I would spend my time during this internship, I made a
            planning for each sprint (2 weeks). Attached below is the sprint
            planning.

            <p data-aos="fade-up">
              Starting off my project was research. The goal for this phase was
              to get a better understanding of sustainability and how it could
              be used to improve businesses in any way. It was also the phase
              where I tried to think out of the box to find innovative ideas by
              doing lots of library research and organizing brainstorms.
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up">
              To have a good baseline, me and my supervisor were able to ask
              ourselves the following research questions to base all research
              on:
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up">
              - How can the WEAR app and its functionality be used from a
              business perspective?
              <br />
              --- Which markets are interesting for HappyGreen?<br />
              --- What type of functionality is interesting for each market?
              (WEAR)<br />
              --- What kind of adjustments are needed within the existing WEAR
              app?
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up">
              To see which ideas my colleagues associate with certain topics, I
              organized a brainstorm in <a href="https://miro.com">Miro</a>.
              This brainstorm consisted of 3 sessions. These were all timed
              sessions, being timed at 1, 3 and 5 minutes respectively. The idea
              of timed sessions created a sense of urgency, which would
              sometimes help creativity. Because we weren't sure about which
              direction we wanted the business WEAR concept to go, I split the
              ideas into 3 categories: ideas for sustainability & CO2 footprint,
              ideas with NFC, and user incentives.

              already implemented into Figma, me and the company both felt it
              was a good idea to use Figma throughout this process.

              There were multiple things I designed while i was at HappyGreen.
              The main project was to design the UI and user flow for the new
              business implementation in the WEAR app, however I also
              experimented with designing other things such as a new login
              screen, a design for the new multi-action (run multiple actions at
              once) for the WEAR app, and other small stuff.

              Since the design was made in Figma, the obvious choice was to use
              Figma for the prototyping aswell. Because my supervisor wasn't
              sure about which navigation type (tab-based, stack-based,
              conditional rendering) to use yet, I made 3 different navigation
              flows that led to the same user flow afterwards. We ended up
              choosing tab-based as it had the best user experience according to
              me and my supervisor.

              The prototyping phase mainly consisted of connecting the screens
              to eachother and making sure all screens were linked to the
              corresponding action. After getting feedback from my supervisor on
              usability and UX of the prototype, I moved on to the next phase
              where I started performing user tests on the prototype.

              Prototype testing started with myself and my supervisor. To
              further test the UX of my design / prototype I used a prototyping
              tool called
              <a href="https://maze.co/">Maze</a>. This app has seamless
              integration with a bunch of design tools including Figma, and I
              used this to give users a series of questions and steps to walk
              through in the app. The users I performed this test on were my
              colleagues.
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up">
              Maze allows the creator of the "maze" (in this case, me) to have
              insights such as how long it took a user to complete a task, and
              helps better understand UX problems within the prototype.

              To hone my skills and get more familiar with technologies used to
              develop the WEAR app, I made a few extra apps and prototypes that
              weren't directly related to WEAR. First off was a "fake" WEAR app
              made from scratch. I developed this to get a better understanding
              of React Native (the framework used to develop the WEAR app) and
              the WEAR API (where all data regarding products and the WEAR app
              is stored). This took me a couple of days and I was able to build
              a pretty good prototype version of the WEAR app from scratch. It
              has functionality to showcase products, filter products, add a
              product to a user, login as a user (using an API token),

              used in the WEAR app to manage states, I made another prototype in
              React Native. This time, I based it off of the existing WEAR app
              by forking the repository and adding a feature to it. The feature
              I worked on was displaying certain Pokemon (with data gathered
              through the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a>) and
              managing their state with Redux, like changing the name

              Besides working on the business designs of WEAR, I was also able
              to redesign some very old login screens. The goal for this
              redesign was to approach a more modern UI style and inspire the
              user to login using a service such as Apple, Google or Facebook.
              Ofcourse keeping in mind the cleanliness and style of the existing
              WEAR app, I went for a clean and modern login screen focusing on
              the social login buttons.
