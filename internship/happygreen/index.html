            From February 2022 to June 2022, I worked as an intern at HappyGreen
            in Eindhoven as a part of my IT & Media Design bachelor's degree at
            the Fontys University of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven.

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            As previously stated, I worked as an intern at HappyGreen for 5
            months. I found HappyGreen with the Fontys internship tool and they
            immediately sparked my interest. After a brief e-mail exchange I
            went to their office for a quick meet & greet and to assess if I was
            the right fit for them.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            I quickly noticed HappyGreen was a small team consisting of young,
            tech-savvy people that wanted to use modern technologies to improve
            the world, which really interested me.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            During my internship I adopted the already existing Agile methods
            used like Scrum. Working in 2-week sprints and a couple of
            daily/weekly stand-ups, I used Jira, as it had a good integration
            with Git and the existing codebase.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            As for Git, this is also what was used throughout this internship
            for code version control. I achieved this by cloning the existing
            repository and then using pull requests and reviews from colleagues
            and superiors to merge my code with the existing code.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The team I worked with consisted of a couple of people.
            <a href="https://github.com/Frankisgek">Frank Keulen</a> (owner,
            internship guide, back-end developer, API manager, resident
            jack-of-all-trades) was my go-to problem solver for all kinds of
            questions during my internship. Besides Frank I also had a lot of
            contact with
            <a href="https://github.com/DaveyvdBogaard"
              >Davey van den Bogaard</a
            >
            (lead front-end developer working on WEAR). Ofcourse I also talked
            with others at HappyGreen, however most of those talks weren't
            directly impacting my internship or project.

            expanding into the latin-american market. A couple of HappyGreen's
            products are: a high-tech mobile hotel room, a personal eco retreat

            The main internship assignment will be based around HappyGreen's
            WEAR app. This is a mobile app thats connected to HappyGreen's NFC
            wearables (wooden accessories like bracelets, sunglasses, watches)
            to control their NFC chip, such as opening Instagram and Spotify or
            unlocking / controlling your Tesla through the app. These actions
            can then be automatically ran by scanning your wearable with your
            phone. The current prototypes for these wearables are mainly focused
            on the consumer side of things. HappyGreen's goal in this is to also
            make WEAR available and attractive from a business perspective.

            The current WEAR app includes a bunch of functionality for the
            wearables. My goal is to find the best ways to integrate
            functionality that can be used by businesses or people in a working
            environment. Some of the current WEAR features include:
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            - Opening apps like Spotify, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp. <br />-
            Shuffling or opening Spotify / Sonos playlists<br />- Controlling
            smarthome accessories like Phillips Hue lights and Nuki smartlocks.
            <br />- Unlocking and controlling a Tesla car.

            Ofcourse these aren't all the features of the WEAR app and as the
            WEAR app is still in development more features will be added in due
            time, but they should give you a general idea of what's possible.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            To start off the project and give myself and HappyGreen a rough idea
            of how I would spend my time during this internship, I made a
            planning for each sprint (2 weeks). Attached below is the sprint
            planning.

            During my internship I didn't only work on the main assignment, but
            also some things that can be placed into the "other" category. Think
            of these as side-projects I worked on that weren't directly
            affecting my main assignment, but helped in other ways such as
            gaining experience with a certain technology used within HappyGreen.

              To hone my skills and get more familiar with technologies used to
              develop the WEAR app, I made a few extra apps and prototypes that
              weren't directly related to WEAR. First off was a "fake" WEAR app
              made from scratch. I developed this to get a better understanding
              of React Native (the framework used to develop the WEAR app) and
              the WEAR API (where all data regarding products and the WEAR app
              is stored). This took me a couple of days and I was able to build
              a pretty good prototype version of the WEAR app from scratch. It
              has functionality to showcase products, filter products, add a
              product to a user, login as a user (using an API token),

              Because I didn't have any experience with
              <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>, which is the technology
              used in the WEAR app to manage states, I made another prototype in
              React Native. This time, I based it off of the existing WEAR app
              by forking the repository and adding a feature to it. The feature
              I worked on was displaying certain Pokemon (with data gathered
              through the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a>) and
              managing their state with Redux, like changing the name
              (client-side) of a Pokemon and storing it in the Redux state.

              Besides working on the business designs of WEAR, I was also able
              to redesign some very old login screens. The goal for this
              redesign was to approach a more modern UI style and inspire the
              user to login using a service such as Apple, Google or Facebook.
              Ofcourse keeping in mind the cleanliness and style of the existing
              WEAR app, I went for a clean and modern login screen focusing on
              the social login buttons.

              After designing the new login screen, I also implemented it by
              rewriting the old React Native code to apply the new styles and
              have cleaner code.
